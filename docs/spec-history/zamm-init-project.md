# ZAMM Init Project Command

Create a `zamm init project` command that sets up a new project with the expected worktree project layout. This should use terminal I/O to ask the user for what the project is about and what the initial stack should be. The project description should be put in docs/README.md (with an autogenerated title), and the stack specification should be put in docs/impls/ with an appropriate filename and title.
