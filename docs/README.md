# Zen and the Automation of Metaprogramming for the Masses

ZAMM is a literate programming tool that tracks the relationship between human-authored requirements and machine-authored code. The cruft that vibe coding produces dilutes the codebase of quality human judgment. As such, this tool aims to preserve the human vision for the project inside of a natural language repository with a high SNR, while providing context on how that human vision was originally achieved via machine-generated code.

The primary goals are to allow for:

- Easy reimplementation of software across different stacks
- Easy maintenance of forked software regardless of major upstream changes

The primary strategy of achieving these goals is by:

- Maintaining a clear and evolving record of project requirements
- Automating implementation and reimplementation tasks
- Preserving the context of architectural decisions as well as the implications of how these decisions interact with individual features
