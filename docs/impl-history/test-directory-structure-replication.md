# Test Directory Structure Replication Implementation Plan

## Goal

Implement the requirement from `docs/test-file-resources.md` to replicate directory structure in test resources instead of flattening all files to the same level.

## Current State Analysis

The test fixtures currently exist in:

- `src/__tests__/fixtures/info/` - Various markdown files
- `src/__tests__/fixtures/organize/` - Before/after pairs for organize command

All test files are currently stored flat within their respective command folders.

## Implementation Plan

1. **Review Existing Test Structure** - Examine current test fixtures and understand how they're used
2. **Identify Files That Need Directory Structure** - Check if any test scenarios require files to be in specific directory structures
3. **Restructure Test Fixtures** - If needed, create subdirectories within fixture folders to preserve realistic file hierarchies
4. **Update Test Code** - Modify test utilities and test files to work with new structure
5. **Verify Tests Still Pass** - Run test suite to ensure no regression

## Expected Changes

Based on initial analysis, this may involve:

- Creating subdirectories in test fixtures
- Updating test utilities to handle directory copying
- Ensuring tests maintain their existing behavior

## Risk Assessment

Low risk - this is primarily a refactoring of test structure that shouldn't affect functionality.
