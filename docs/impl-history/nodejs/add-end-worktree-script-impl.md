# Add End Worktree Script Implementation

## Implementation Approach

Created a bash script `dev/end-worktree.sh` that follows the exact workflow specified in the development scripts specification. The script provides a standardized way to wrap up work in Git worktrees.

## Key Implementation Details

### Script Structure

- Added input validation to prevent running from main/master branches
- Used `git branch --show-current` to get current branch name dynamically
- Used `basename "$(pwd)"` to extract worktree directory name
- Added error handling with `set -e` to exit on any command failure

### NodeJS-Specific Adaptations

- **User Feedback Integration**: Initially implemented generic build system detection, but user feedback correctly pointed out this should be tailored to the NodeJS implementation
- **Build Command**: Changed from generic build detection to specific `npm run build` as documented in `docs/impls/nodejs.md`
- This ensures the script is optimized for the current project rather than being overly generic

### Script Steps Implementation

1. **Validation**: Checks current branch is not main/master
2. **Directory Change**: `cd ../base` to move to main project directory
3. **Merge**: Uses `claude "Merge the $CURRENT_BRANCH branch into main"` for interactive merge
4. **Cleanup**: `git worktree remove` and `git branch -d` to clean up
5. **Build**: `npm run build` specifically for NodeJS implementation
6. **Sync**: `git push` to update remote

## User Collaboration Notes

**Critical Lesson**: When user provides feedback requiring code changes, immediately stage those changes with `git add` before attempting to commit. This was a recurring issue that caused commit failures.

## File Location

Script created at: `dev/end-worktree.sh` (executable permissions set)
