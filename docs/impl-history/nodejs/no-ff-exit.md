# Implementation: Prevent Fast-Forward Merges and Exit on Merge Failure in end-worktree.sh

This document describes the implementation of spec GMR022 for the NodeJS implementation.

## Implementation Overview

Modified the `dev/end-worktree.sh` bash script to:

1. Explicitly instruct Claude not to use fast-forward merges when merging feature branches back to main
2. Check if the Claude merge command completed successfully and exit immediately if it failed

## Changes Made

### File: `dev/end-worktree.sh`

**Line 29**: Updated the Claude command prompt to include explicit no-fast-forward instruction:

```bash
claude "Merge the $CURRENT_BRANCH branch into main. Do not use a fast-forward merge."
```

**Lines 31-35**: Added merge success validation:

```bash
# Check if the Claude merge succeeded
if ! git merge-base --is-ancestor "$CURRENT_BRANCH" HEAD; then
    echo "Error: Claude merge did not complete successfully. Exiting."
    exit 1
fi
```

## Implementation Notes

### Merge Success Detection Strategy

The implementation uses `git merge-base --is-ancestor` to verify that the feature branch has been successfully merged into the current branch (main). This command:

- Returns true (exit code 0) if `$CURRENT_BRANCH` is an ancestor of `HEAD`, meaning the merge was successful
- Returns false (exit code 1) if the merge did not complete, which triggers the script to exit

This approach reliably detects if Claude exited prematurely without completing the merge, preventing the script from proceeding to remove worktrees and delete branches when the merge hasn't been completed.

### No Complexities Encountered

The implementation was straightforward:

- No edge cases encountered during implementation
- The bash script structure was already well-organized for adding the merge check
- The `set -e` flag at the top of the script ensures proper error propagation
- No changes were needed to other parts of the codebase
