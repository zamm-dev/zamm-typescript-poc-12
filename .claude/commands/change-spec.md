# Make new changes to spec

You are in a fresh Git worktree directory. You are here to update the spec with the new desired changes. Follow these steps:

1. Run `git diff main` to understand the spec changes that are being requested
2. Make the relevant changes in @docs/specs/ . Correct existing documentation as needed. Do not modify the code or files in any other part of the project.
3. Commmit
4. Set up this worktree according to the instructions in @docs/impls/nodejs.md so that the next implementation agent can come in and start work immediately.
